        <div class="introduction">
            <p>I have lived in Australia for 10 years now.<br>
                I spent time in both New Zealand and Australia as part of working holiday program and then studied
                English
                at school in Canada.<br>
                I was tired of city life in Tokyo, Japan and moved to Tasmania, a place that is surrounded by beautiful
                nature.<br>
                I enjoy walking along the beach with my dog, going camping in the summer, having nice coffee at cafe and
                spending time relaxing in rich nature. </p>
            <p>I have loved reading books since I was a child, and when I was in primary school, the number of books I
                could
                borrow from school on weekends was not enough, so I would borrow books from the public library as well
                and
                immerse myself in reading. To this day libraries and bookstores are a couple of my favourite places.
                Time
                flies when I walk around to browsing for a book. I feel like I am being drawn into the world of the
                story
                within the books; the thrill of turning to the next page...<br>
                For me, web design is the same. I get so much enjoyment from it, that I sometimes lose track of time and
                get
                lost in it.<br>
                I am committed to creating designs that combine my book-borne imagination and my various artistic and
                technical backgrounds, to bring your vision to life. Great web design allows the viewer to feel the
                world on
                the page and the wonder of what is beyond.</p>
            <p>I have strong skills in design pertaining to the beauty field. I hold manicurist and gel nail
                certifications
                at the highest level of JNA (the Japan Nailist Association), and a beautician's license in hairdressing.
                Following my time as a hairdresser, I worked as a manicurist and have been involved in the beauty
